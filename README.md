# DIY 3DP Ventilator - RC-Servo -
A 3D printed DIY Ventilator using RC Servos

## WIP ##

Target of this project is to produce a 3D printed ventilator using RC Servos and an Ambu SPUR or Ambu MARK ventilator bag.

You need one of the Ambu bag, two RC Servo, a DC Power Supply (5-6v, 30-40w) and a Arduino to drive this ventilator.

Status:

Project is Work in Porgress. It is not in a working state, but it can do some limited action.
It does not have any interface yet, you need to modify the Arduino source code for any changes.

I do hope this will never be needed as a serious medical applications.
